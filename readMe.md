Overview
Provide a brief description of the project here. This could include what the project does, its purpose, and any important context. For example:

"This project is a full-stack application built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It aims to provide a seamless user experience for managing data across multiple modules."

Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following software installed:

Node.js (version X.X or above)
npm or yarn
Installation
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ak17rp25/Data-Grid.git
cd project-name
2. Install dependencies
Backend:
Go to the backend directory and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Frontend:
Go to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontEnd
npm install
Note: The node_modules directories are ignored by Git (using .gitignore), so you'll need to install them locally for each module.

Running the Application
Backend
To start the backend server, run the following command in the backend directory:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start your backend application, typically accessible on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend
To start the frontend application, run the following command in the frontEnd directory:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev/npm start
This will start your frontend application, typically accessible on http://localhost:5173.

.gitignore
The .gitignore file is configured to exclude certain files and directories from being tracked by Git, including:

node_modules directories in both the backend and frontEnd directories, to avoid versioning large dependencies and to ensure they are installed locally.
Example .gitignore content:
gitignore
Copy code
# Ignore backend node_modules
./backend/node_modules/

# Ignore frontend node_modules
./frontEnd/node_modules/
